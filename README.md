# LENDING CLUB CASE STUDY
    
The dataset provided contains historical information about individuals who applied for loans and whether they experienced a 'default' event. The objective is to discern recurring trends that can help predict the likelihood of loan default. This insight can guide decision-making processes, including loan approval, loan amount adjustments, and the application of higher interest rates for riskier candidates.

We largely followed following steps for the EDA:

1. **Comprehending the Loan Dataset:**
   - Gained a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's contents, variables, and attributes.

2. **Data Cleansing:**
   - Eliminated inconsistencies and errors from the dataset to ensure accuracy in subsequent analyses.

3. **Data Enhancement:**
   - Enhanceed the dataset by addressing missing or incomplete information, that lead to improving data quality.

4. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Conducted a univariate examination of individual variables to uncover preliminary patterns and characteristics.

5. **Segmented Univariate Analysis:**
   - Performed a more focused univariate analysis by segmenting data based on specific criteria, revealing nuanced insights.

6. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Investigate relationships between pairs of variables to uncover potential associations and dependencies.

7. **Variable Correlation Assessment:**
   - Explore the correlation between different variables to identify potential interdependencies.

8. **Drawing Conclusions:**
   - Summarize the key findings and insights gained from the data analysis.

## Conclusions
a. To mitigate the risk of loan defaults, Lending Club ought to consider lowering the interest rates on loans with a 60-month tenure that currently carry high rates. 

b. Utilizing grades as a reliable indicator, Lending Club could enhance its default prediction by requesting additional information from potential borrowers falling within the lower grade range (G to A) prior to loan approval. 

c. Given the higher default rate associated with small business loans, Lending Club should contemplate either reducing or ceasing the issuance of loans to this category. 

d. Lending Club should exercise caution when granting loans exceeding $12,000 to borrowers who possess mortgage home ownership, as they appear to be both requesting larger loan amounts and exhibiting a higher propensity for default. 


By diligently following these steps, we aim to extract meaningful information from the dataset that can be used to make informed decisions related to loan management and risk assessment.
